*Please read this document carefully before posting or sharing comments, opinions, videos, livestreams, mods, custom maps, households, or lots. By sharing content on any of the officially supported platforms, you also agree that you have read all the information below.*

As part of the goal of Tiny Life's design, we want to foster a community of players that are accepting, kind and have the ability to **express their creativity**, **explore their identity**, and **share their feedback**. As such, the following rules are very permissive of custom content and community interaction of any kind, with restrictions that aim to minimize unease or harm in the community.

All content that does not follow these rules will be removed from the official platforms, and their authors may be banned or restricted for a period of time at the moderators' discretion.

For example, when posting a video about the game, Tiny Life's name should be included in the title, description or video content.

While not actively encouraged for the sake of the community, you are free to place mods or other types of custom content "behind a paywall."
