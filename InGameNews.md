# Tiny Life Post-0.48 Feature Survey
Hi everyone, we hope you've been enjoying the **Out & About Set update**!

Occasionally, we do **small surveys** for players, which helps us grasp what features you all would like to see next, and what sorts of improvements you're hoping for in the short-term future of the game!

If you have a few minutes (5 to 10 at the most), please fill out [this anonymous form](https://link.tinylifegame.com/tl048survey). ‚ù§Ô∏è
