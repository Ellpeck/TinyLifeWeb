# Tiny Life Content and Community Policy

*Please read this document carefully before posting or sharing comments, opinions, videos, livestreams, mods, custom maps, households, or lots. By sharing content on any of the officially supported platforms, you also agree that you have read all the information below.*

As part of the goal of Tiny Life's design, we want to foster a community of players that are accepting, kind and have the ability to **express their creativity**, **explore their identity**, and **share their feedback**. As such, the following rules are very permissive of custom content and community interaction of any kind, with restrictions that aim to minimize unease or harm in the community.

All content that does not follow these rules will be removed from the official platforms, and their authors may be banned or restricted for a period of time at the moderators' discretion.

## Tiny Life Content on the Internet
- ✔️ You are free (and encouraged!) to create and share or post comments, opinions, videos, livestreams, blog posts, and other content that shows off or relates to Tiny Life and its gameplay. When doing so, be sure to make it sufficiently clear that the content you are showing off is associated with Tiny Life. For example, when posting a video about the game, Tiny Life's name should be included in the title, description or video content.
- ✔️ You are free to **monetize** and otherwise earn revenue from videos, livestreams, blog posts, and other content that shows off or relates to Tiny Life and its gameplay. This includes content about or featuring Tiny Life that contains the game's soundtrack as background or prominently featured music.
- ✔️ You are free to share any custom content of any kind for Tiny Life outside the official platforms. When doing so, be sure to make it sufficiently clear what parts are your creations, and what parts are Tiny Life's original content.
- ❌ You are not allowed to **reupload or otherwise redistribute** the Tiny Life binary, assets, or code. If you want people to be able to find the game easily, it is recommended that you link to its website https://tinylifegame.com.
