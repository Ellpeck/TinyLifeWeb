If you're interested in contributing new languages to Tiny Life's localization or editing the text of existing translations, it is greatly appreciated! Sadly, I don't have the ability to pay translators right now, so any work you do will be volunteer-based. That being said, you will, of course, be credited in the game's Credits Menu with a link to a social media profile of your choice, and you will greatly contribute to the game's community!

If you want to join the team of translators, the first step is to message Ellpeck, either privately after joining [the Discord server](https://link.tinylifegame.com/discordweb), or in the `#tinylife` channel. If you don't have access to Discord, you can email [ell@tinylifegame.com](mailto:ell@tinylifegame.com?subject=Tiny%20Life%20Localization%20Contribution) instead. You'll also need an account on [the translation site](https://translate.ellpeck.de/), where you can log in directly with a GitHub or Discord account.

## Notes on Translating
First of all: Please don't feel obligated to finish the translation for the language you're working on! Since you're doing this for free, I don't expect you to, either. An incomplete translation means that some in-game text will still be translated, and it also means that anyone who comes along after you will have less work to do!

### About Translations
- You should generally be **fluent** in both English and the language you're translating to. While machine translation can be helpful for getting a basic translation, the final text should always be written by a human who understands the nuances of the original text and its translation.
- In this document, I'm using the words "translate" and "localize" semi-interchangeably, but it should be noted that this is a **localization**, meaning any jokes or references that don't make sense in the language you're translating for should be edited to make them sound logical.  
  *For example, a pun like `Standing Up to Sitting` might not work well in other languages, where "standing up to something" is not a valid figure of speech. As a result, the translation shouldn't literally reference the act of standing up if it doesn't also mean "making a defense against something".*
- I know that this is difficult to accomplish in some languages, but please try to keep gender-specific language to a minimum. If this is entirely impossible in your language, please try to use constructs that your place of residence usually sticks to, similar to the English "Latinx" or the German "Mitarbeiter:in".
- Tiny Life is an inclusive game, for all genders, sexualities, and identities. Even if the language you translate for is used by a country where you fear that certain aspects of the game might be ill-received, translations **should not be altered** to remove references to any such things.
- Tiny Life should be suitable for as many audiences as possible, so please avoid using sexually explicit terms and stick to innuendo when it comes to *fooling around* and the like. In a lot of cases, this is less of a concern about the game's audience and more of a concern about the game's age ratings in stores.
- The proper noun for a person in the game is "a Tiny", with the English plural being "Tinies". This term can be slightly or heavily varied based on the language, as long as it's kept consistent. *For example, German words adapted from English usually don't use `ie` instead of `y` for plural, so the German plural is "Tinys".*

### Using the Translation Site
- You don't need any kind of programming or advanced file editing experience, since you'll be translating on the previously mentioned translation site. When translating, you should set an existing language as your `reference locale` (preferably English), since most of the term names don't give much information about the actual content of the text they represent.
- To get started translating, simply select the "Review" section in the left sidebar of the project, and then select the language you're working on from the dropdown at the top. All the strings that are either untranslated, or whose English versions have changed, will be listed here. Once you're happy with a string's translation, you can press the green checkmark button to mark it as completed.
- Some of the things listed in the "Checks" section and below your translations **should not be addressed**, as they are generalized and do not apply to Tiny Life's localization. Specifically, all issues that aren't related to spelling and grammar should be ignored. To list game-specific issues with your localization, see the [Testing Your Translations](#testing-your-translations) section below.
- For languages that are already selectable in the game, **all translation text** will automatically be included in new versions of the game. This includes text that is [not marked as reviewed](https://github.com/mirego/accent/issues/403). Please keep this in mind when translating and don't include any unfinished translations or placeholder text.

### Technical Notes
- Please keep in mind that a lot of strings have limited space in the game. Translations for things like button labels, object names, and single-term strings should be kept at about the same width as their English counterparts, if possible. Testing your translations, as described below, is the best way to ensure that all text looks good in the game.
- There are several placeholders and formatting codes that **should not be deleted or changed**, notably:
  - `{0}`, `{1}`, etc. are placeholders for text that is fed into the localized term dynamically. The order of these placeholders is not important, but the number that they contain is.  
    *For example, in `Should {0} really scrap their book {1}?`, the `{0}` will be replaced with the person's name, and the `{1}` will be replaced with the name of a book. If your localization requires that the book's name is placed before the person's name in the sentence, all you have to do is swap the order of these placeholders.*
  - `<tb>`, `<i ...>` and other constructs that are surrounded by `<` and `>` are formatting codes. These should be kept in place, and any additional text between the `<` and `>` should also be kept in place.  
    *For example, in `You can rotate furniture by pressing <k Rotate>.`, the formatting code will be replaced with the key value of the keybind to rotate furniture and other objects. If the word `Rotate` in it was changed (or translated), the link to the keybind would be broken.*

### Testing Your Translations
To test your translation, you can export it and put it into the game. To export it, head to the "Files" section in the left sidebar, and then press the `Localization.json` file's export button, which looks like a little cardboard box. In the menu that comes up, select the language you're working on from the dropdown, and leave everything else the same. Now, you can put the exported file into the `Content/Localization` folder of the game's installation. If it's not part of it already, its name also has to be added to the `LanguageNames.json` file.

When testing your translations, please start the game with the `-v` (or `--verbose`) argument. This will cause it to output some additional information about errors in your localization to the game's [log file](game_dir.md), as well as the special `_ValidateLanguagesLog.txt` file in the game data folder. An automatically created version of this file is also uploaded as a [GitHub Gist](https://link.tinylifegame.com/validate-languages-log) periodically. **Fixing errors like these is very important**, as they can cause players to receive incorrect or incomplete information or, in some cases, cause the game to crash.

### Special Localization Strings
There are several localization strings that have to have special formatting, most of which are validated as part of the [validation process](#testing-your-translations).
- `DisplayLastNamesFirst` determines the order that a Tiny's first and last names are displayed in. The game defaults to displaying first names first, but this can be changed for languages where the last name is usually displayed first.
- `GenderedPronouns` should store whether the language supports gendered pronouns. This determines whether the pronoun customization menu, as well as Tinies' pronouns, should be displayed in-game.
- `DefaultPronouns` should be three entries separated by commas, which represent the pronouns that a Tiny can have assigned to them randomly. These should be ordered as masculine, feminine, and gender neutral. If a language doesn't have gender-neutral (neo)pronouns, the third entry should be a localized version of "any pronouns" or "no preference".
- `NameGenerationContinentPriority` is a list of two-letter continent codes that determines the likelihood of names from that region being chosen when a Tiny is randomly generated. Entries at the start of the list are more likely to be chosen.
- Tiny names, which end with `FirstLast`, should be the first and last name of the Tiny, separated by a comma. They should be in first, last order even when the language displays last names first.

## Notes for Specific Languages
### Dutch
- The singular and plural for Tinies is "Tiny" and "Tiny's", respectively.

### English
- Titles (like object names, action names, skill names, etc.) use [title case](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Title_case) in the English version of the game. Generally, short and less important words like *a*, *an*, *the*, and *to* are not capitalized. For languages that don't generally use title case, this is not necessary.
- The names of achievements in the English versions are references to popular culture. In other languages, they can be pretty much anything else, including popular culture references that make sense in the context of the language, provided they also abide by the information above.

### German
- The German localization uses gender-neutral language (*Geschlechtergerechte Sprache*) for its translations. The following spellings are used:
  - "Er/sie", "sein/ihr" and other pronouns that can't be appreviated neatly are combined using a forward slash.
  - "Mitarbeiter:in", "Partner:in" and other words that have the same structure are abbreviated using a colon (*Gender-Doppelpunkt*) if possible.
  - The word "Tiny" is gender-neutral: "ein:e Tiny", "der/die Tiny".
- The plural of "Tiny" is spelled with a `y`, in keeping with other words borrowed from English: "die Tinys".
- Achievement names in the German localization are just brief, funny descriptions of the achievement.

### Italian
- The Italian localization uses gender-neutral language for its translations. The following spellings are used:
  - "Il/la", "tuoi/tue" and other words that change according to their gender and that can't be abbreviated neatly are combined using a forward slash.
  - "Su*, bambin* and other words that have the same structure are abbreviated using an asterisk if possible.
  - The word "Tiny" is gender-neutral: "un* Tiny", "il/la Tiny".
- The plural of foreign words that have no translation follows this rule:
  - If the word is already in common use in Italian, its plural will be the same as the singular form: "film", "bar".
  - If the word is new or highly specialized, its plural will be the same as it is in its origin language: "Tinies".

### Polish
- The Polish localization uses gender-neutral language (*Język neutralny płciowo*) for its translations.
  - "Ono/jego" is used as the default pronoun for every word in the game.
  - Avoid using gendered words in all cases. If using one can't be avoided, use "ono" instead of "on" or "ona".
  - The word "Tiny" is gender-neutral: "to Tiny".
- The plural of "Tiny" is spelled with a `y`, in keeping with other words borrowed from English: "te Tinys".
- Achievement names in the Polish localization are just brief, funny descriptions of the achievement. They don't have to be word for word translations.
